IMPORTANT:
1. Don't forget to "pip install streamlit"
2. Make sure the OpenAI API is exact same with LM Studio / any OpenAI API that you want to use.
3. You can change the embedding model whatever you like.
4. The Embedding model load in CPU not GPU. If you want to use Nvidia GPU, change "CPU" to "cuda"
5. Have Fun!
